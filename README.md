## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Purpose of this analysis was to help our friend Maria with the school district analysis. In the student_complete.csv file, there is some grades that seem to be altered. Academic dishonesty: specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders that appear to be altered. Since school board does not know the reason for this academic dishonesty, they have asked our friend Maria to help. We are analyzing math and reading scores for Thomas High school with NaNs. We are going to perform full analysis on school district. 

## Results: 
### District Summary Effect: 
•	There are no major changes in district summary, it does decrease the passing percentage by an exceedingly small amount. This can be eliminated if we round the percent and remove any decimals. 
- Passing math grade and passing reading grades are the same as previous district summary.

•	The school summary is affected in the data row for Thomas High School. The reading, math, and overall percent seems to be high before for Thomas High School and after our analysis they have a significant drop which shows that the grades might be altered. 

### Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools:

Replacing the nine graders reading and math scores have caused Thomas high school performance to drop. Both reading percent, math percent and overall percent is all dropped.

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade: 

•	Replacing the ninth-grade scores did not have any affect on the math and reading scoring. It was a very minor change in the percent.
